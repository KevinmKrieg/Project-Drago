# Project-Drago
Project for a wearable tech class at the University of Wisconsin. The arduino code controlls a lilypad microcontroller, which was sewn with conductive threading, to a black arm sleeve. The sleeve would then be worn during olympic weightlifting to measure power production, and velocity for training purposes.
